# st2195_assignment_3

This repository contains the code for Practice Assignment 3 of the ST2195 course.

The SQLite database is constructed using the **Data Expo 2009 airline on-time performance dataset**, 
which is publicly available via the **Harvard Dataverse**.

The data were downloaded from:
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7

Due to the size of the database, the SQLite file is not included in this repository.

1. a README.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment and a
reference to the Data Expo 2009 data, and the Harvard Dataverse [1 point]
2. a folder called “r_sql” with a R code for constructing the database (from the csv
inputs) and replicating the queries in the practice quiz. The latter should be done
both using DBI and dplyr notation [1.75 points each]
3. a folder called “python_sql” with a Python version of the code in point 2, based
on sqlite3 [1.75 points]
4. A simplified solution for the query in Q4 in either R or Python (placed either in
the R or Python *_sql folder) [1.75 points]
